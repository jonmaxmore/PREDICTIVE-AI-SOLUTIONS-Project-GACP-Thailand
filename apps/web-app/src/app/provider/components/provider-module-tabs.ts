/**
 * Module sub-navigation for the provider portal — which tabs a route gets.
 *
 * Why this lives here rather than in a route `layout.tsx`.
 *
 * The provider chrome (header, nav, footer) is NOT in the Next route layout:
 * `provider/layout.tsx` renders only `<>{children}</>` and each page imports a
 * `ProviderLayout` *component* instead. Two modules used to draw their tab bar
 * from a real route-level `layout.tsx`, and Next nests a route layout above the
 * page it wraps — so those tab bars rendered above the global header (measured:
 * sub-nav at top:0, header at top:69).
 *
 * Hoisting the chrome into the route layout is the proper fix, but it means
 * rewriting 92 `<ProviderLayout>` call sites and rehoming the title/subtitle
 * props 36 of them pass. Until that happens the rule runs the other way: chrome
 * is inside the page, so the module tabs must be inside it too.
 *
 * `ProviderLayout` therefore derives its tabs from the pathname through this
 * module, and the sub-layouts are gone. One place decides what a route gets,
 * no page has to remember to wire anything up, and a module page added later
 * gets its tab bar — in the right position — without being told to.
